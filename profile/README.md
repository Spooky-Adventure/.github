# Spooky Adventure Organization README
This account hosts the resources and code used by Super Mario Spooky Adventure, a 1-world NSMBW hack. Of course,
if things are missing, don't be worried! The mod isn't done yet, so of course this will be incomplete!

# Our Repositories
## [Spooky Adventure][ghRes]
This is our primary repository, where certain Spooky Adventure resources can be found.
Some of the resources you'll find here are:
- Koopatlas World Maps (.KPMAP files)
- Doodad images (decorations on the world maps)
- Various logos/splashes & source files
- Custom tileset images & source files
- Development notes and the likes

These will be added when Spooky Adventure is released, so stay tuned~

## [Spooky Adventure Source Code][ghSRC]
This repository contains the source code used to compile and run Spooky Adventure.
It is based off of the [NewerSMBW source code][newerSRC], however it is not a fork
of the repository because forks cannot be made private, and if I ever decide i want
to make the source code private until release, a fork wouldn't let me do it.

Be sure to check in there to find out more about it!

## General Info

### What is Super Mario Spooky Adventure?

Super Mario Spooky Adventure is a 1-world hack for New Super Mario Bros. Wii, based on the [NewerSMBW framework][newer].
It will contain one world of original levels, split among two world maps, as well as other surprises.
It takes place on a strange island inhabited by the undead, and a large underground cavern beneath the isle...

### How can I find out more about Spooky Adventure?

Well, you can subscribe to our [YouTube channel][yt], and enable notifications to be updated whenever we post a new video.

OR, you can join our [Discord server][discord], and do the following:
- Use the command ``!progress-report`` to receive a short status update for the project.
- Check out `#previews` and `#announcements`, we will post sneek-peek content there from time to time.

### When is Spooky Adventure being released?

We have no set release date, and a deadline of Halloween 2023 will not be possible to meet (at least not without rushing the mod
and cutting so many corners it becomes a circle), however late 2024 may be possible, we will have to see what the future holds.

### Will you release a demo, or portion of the mod for us to play?

No, I have no plans to, this mod is too short to release a demo. If I were to release a demo,
I'd only be able to release probably three levels, and let's be honest, who wants to play a three level demo?

### After Spooky Adventure gets released, will there be another project, or a content update of sorts?

As of right now, no, we have no plans for another project, however, we'll have to see what the future holds.

## Spooky Adventure's Release

### Will Super Mario Spooky Adventure be free upon release? Will I have to pay anything to download the mod?

Yes, the project will be free upon release, and you will not have to pay or do anything to be able to download the mod.

### So... how do I set up Spooky Adventure upon release?

A detailed guide will be coming in the future, but it's the same as any other Riivolution patch.

### How can I play Super Mario Spooky Adventure upon release? Can I play it in Dolphin Emulator?

You can play Spooky Adventure on a Wii console (or a WiiU, in the virtualWii mode), as well as in Dolphin Emulator!

[Wii Console][setupWii]

[Dolphin Emu][setupDol]

Please note that we will not assist you in building a mod ISO, you can do that on your own.

### Can you guys provide me with an ISO/WBFS/RVZ or a dumped filesystem of the game?

No, we will not provide you with any form of the game, as we do not condone piracy.
You will need to dump your own game files with your own NSMBW disc, on your own Wii.

### What if I don't own a Wii console or a NSMBW disc?

You can buy one, they're not that expensive. Wii's are cheap nowadays, NSMBW discs are even cheaper.

### Can I use a Wii Mini or a WiiU for this?

Well, a WiiU will likely work, though we haven't tested hacking the vWii mode on it.
As for a Wii Mini, we're not sure, but if you wanna at least try, go for it.

### What versions of the game will Spooky Adventure support?

Spooky Adventure will support every *Wii* version of NSMBW. This means it currently does not support the WiiU eShop release(s),
nor the Chinese Nvidia Shield release.

## Developer Information

**Can I apply for a developer position, or *any* kind of helping position in the project?**
To join the team, join our Discord server, and DM the owner stating what modding skills you possess, as well as some work to show off
your ability in those skills. If you're applying to make levels, for example, show off some of your best levels! Don't hold back, show off just what you can do!

(if you wanna do a joke application, we don't mind, but at least try to be creative with whatever you submit)
