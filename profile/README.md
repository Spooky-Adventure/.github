# Spooky Adventure Organization README
This account hosts the resources and code used by Super Mario Spooky Adventure, a work-in-progress NSMBW hack. Of course,
if things are missing, don't be worried! The mod isn't done yet, so of course this will be incomplete!

For more information about the project, join our [Discord Server][discord]!

## Our Repositories
### [Spooky Adventure Resources][ghRes]
This is our primary repository, where certain Spooky Adventure resources can be found.
Some of the resources you'll find here are:
- Koopatlas World Maps (.KPMAP files)
- Doodad images (decorations on the world maps)
- Various logos/splashes & source files
- Custom tileset images & source files
- Development notes and the likes
- Much more...

These will be added when Spooky Adventure is released, so stay tuned~

### [Spooky Adventure Source Code][ghSRC]
This repository contains the source code used to compile and run Spooky Adventure.
It is based off of the [NewerSMBW source code][newerSRC], however it is not a fork
of the repository because forks cannot be made private, and if I ever decide I want
to make the source code private until release, a fork wouldn't let me do it.

Be sure to check in there to find out more about it!

### [Spooky Adventure Website][ghWebsite]
Our website, currently a work-in-progress. There's really not much to say
about it right now, it's not got much to it.
